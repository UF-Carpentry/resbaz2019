# Who can attend?

The event is aimed at researchers at all levels from all disciplines based in south east Queensland. ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.

If you are a Master's or PhD student, or an early career researcher, then ResBaz Brisbane is definitely for you! ResBaz Brisbane will help you find others across a range of universities who are exploring the same research problems or trying to learn the same tools and skills. 

ResBaz Brisbane will definitely be one of the most worthwhile networking and skill-building opportunities you can attend in Brisbane this year - and it's fantastic value.  

# What will I learn?

We will offer introductory workshops such as Software Carpentry with R and Software Carpentry with Python, as well as workshops on data clean up and data visualisation, and tips on boosting your research profile. See the program below. You can opt in to various workshops when you register. You can learn how to program in R or Python, see how to automate workflows, how to keep track of different versions of things and then tell stories with your data. Interested in mapping? There will be a GIS workshop and a Galaxy workshop for those wanting to learn about RNA sequencing. Want to run a Jupyter notebook in the cloud? We can show you how. And you can see the Tinker workbench in operation too. It's all happening in those first two days.

The first two days (9-10 July) are action-packed with many [workshops](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/brisbane/#classes) to choose from. Lunch will be provided as part of your registration fee. On the third day (11 July), you can attend a range of fantastic talks, play games, browse stalls, book time with an expert, view each other's posters, network with others in the knowledge bazaar, win prizes or just chill out with people you've met.

# How much is registration?

ResBaz is run by volunteers, but our generous host (QUT) and our many [sponsors](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/brisbane/#sponsors) cover most of the overheads, making the event affordable for participants.
