# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2019, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

<b>ResBaz Gainesville will be hosted by the University of Florida on September 11-13</b>, with organizational and funding support from the [UF Carpentry Club](https://uf-carpentry.org).

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!

There will be three half-days of activities including talks, lunch, career panel, tutorials, demos, and social events. This is a chance for students and researchers across UF to come together to learn, share knowledge and skills, and meet others. 

## Code of Conduct

In order to create and inclusive and supporting environment, and as with other events supported by the UF Carpentry Club, we ask everyone to follow the [Carpentriesâ€™ Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
