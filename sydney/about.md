# About

Sydney's Research Bazaar is a low-cost, 4-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

## Who should attend?

Researchers at all levels from all disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along! This year there's a special training program for Library staff as well.

ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.
