# Overview

This year, ResBaz Sydney has three parts: a <a href="#resbaz-sydney-festival">festival</a>, <a href="#resbaz-sydney-training-workshops">training workshops</a>, and a special <a href="#resbaz-sydney-compute-day">compute day</a> (with workshops) on the Friday.

Separate tickets are available for the festival and training workshops (general workshops, compute day workshops and library and research support workshops).

## ResBaz Sydney Festival

Join us for:

Whether you're new to ResBaz or have been to one or two before, this is the place to start. Introduce yourself to the community through a <a href="present.html#present">poster</a>, or just come along and soak it all up.
