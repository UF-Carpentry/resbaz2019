#Poster Submissions

Deadline: 23rd August

Each participant is strongly encouraged to submit an <a href="present.html">electronic poster</a> detailing the tools they work with and the areas they would like to get started in. This is your chance to connect with fellow researchers with common interests attending ResBaz.

#Registration

Training workshops and the festival are separately ticketed this year. Many training workshops are sold out (join the waitlist), but there are still tickets available for the festival.
