# Poster Submissions

Deadline for submission: **23rd August**

Each participant is strongly encouraged to submit an electronic poster detailing the tools they work with and the areas they would like to get started in. This is your chance to connect with fellow researchers with common interests attending ResBaz.

Please do not stress about creating a poster! It's completely fine if you only have a few things to list. The point of this is simply to start conversations about the tools that we use or are interested in and help people with complementary interests find each other.

Posters will be displayed during ResBaz and people will get to chat with you about your project, tools and challenges during the Poster and Networking Session.

Below are instructions on how to submit your poster:

- Duplicate the poster slide <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfpiqixQvgy-swpxBIy5dS6sLf4Vr83JcTJ2B3GKtlc/edit?usp=sharing">template</a> (File > Make a Copy)

- Populate the duplicate slide with your own content (check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n_KNDbWjQ6m6O7SQUbyLJiJ8DY4u6KX6RhpW23chzRk/edit?usp=sharing">example posters</a> for ideas)

- Send the file or share a link to your poster (remember itâ€™ll be in A1 format) to us at <a href="mailto:resbazsydney@googlegroups.com">resbazsydney@googlegroups.com</a>.
