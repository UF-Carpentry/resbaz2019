# Workshop detail

## Introduction to R for Reproducible Research

Are you looking for more efficient methods to analyse large datasets?  This beginners' workshop introduces R-Studio and the R programming language.  Using real datasets it teaches data management techniques including how to structure, manipulate and visualise data.  No previous knowledge is required.  Note: For the full Software Carpentry experience, students are requested to attend the Git and Shell lessons, providing a solid foundational basis for transparent and reproducible research. Students may also be interested in more data manipulation in the SQL workshop

## Introduction to Python

This beginners' workshop will introduce programming and data analysis with Python. We will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, data management, and task automation. No previous knowledge required. Note: For the full Software Carpentry experience, students are requested to attend the Git and Shell lessons, providing a solid foundational basis for transparent and reproducible research. Students may also be interested in more data manipulation in the SQL workshop

## Introduction to Unix

This beginners’ workshop will introduce students to the command line. Students will learn how to navigate the file system, work with documents, automate tasks and write and execute scripts. No previous knowledge required. Especially beneficial for attendees of the R and python courses on days 1 – 2.

## Introduction to Git and version control

Do you want to make sure you never lose your work? Never have a supervisor accidentally delete a critical analysis result? See exactly which code you ran 7 months ago? This beginners’ workshop will introduce students to version control using git – a magic tool that does all this and more! No previous knowledge required. Especially beneficial for attendees of the R and python courses on days 1 – 2.

## Introduction to SQL

This Software Carpentry inspired workshop will present the Using Databases and SQL lesson. This workshop is appropriate for beginners with no programming knowledge. We will use a dataset inspired by William Dyer, Frank Pabodie, and Valentina Roerich's expeditions to the Pole of Inaccessibility in the South Pacific to learn how to explore, manipulate, and create a database. Databases include powerful tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets -- and can scale more effectively than spreadsheets.

## Geospatial data analysis using R

Are you an R user who’s really wanted to work with geospatial data? In this workshop, we’ll introduce key geospatial concepts, then explore them using live coding with the Data Carpentry Geospatial Curriculum.  We’ll also talk about some Australian-specific things that are not in the main Carpentries, but are useful if you’re working with this data down under. PREREQUISITE: you need to be COMFORTABLE using R, and debugging your own scripts.

## Introduction to REDCap
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a powerful and widely used electronic data capture platform, designed to replace paper-based surveys and spreadsheet-based data capture systems. Aimed at beginners, this workshop covers topics that include: creating a REDCap project and instruments/forms, overview of various field types, branching logic, adding/editing records, tracking data entry and access management.

## Longitudinal Trials with REDCap
This workshop introduces some of REDCap’s more advanced features for running longitudinal studies. Aimed at intermediate/advanced users, this workshop covers topics that include: building a longitudinal project, managing participants through multiple events, configuring and using Automated Survey Invitations (ASI), using Smart Variables to add powerful features to your logic and understanding data structure of a longitudinal project.

## The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp)

This is a 3 day unconference for humanities researchers with an interest in technology. The agenda for the unconference is set on the first day. The areas covered are up to the participants. In last year's THATCamp, we covered topics like web scraping, mapping, text analysis, Trove, tools for music analysis, Omeka and visual analysis tools.

For a sense of how THATCamps generally run, see their <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">main site</a>.

## Visualisation in Python

Learn visualisation in Python using the Seaborn and the Matplotlib libraries.

## Visualisation in R

Learn visualisation in R using the ggplot2 package

## Librarian and Research Support Stream

This program includes 6 dedicated workshops for librarians and research support staff

- ResBaz orientation and networking
- Impact advocacy: how to help researchers with impact stories
- Workforce skills development: how do we meet researcher needs?
- Good data management practices for internal library processes
- International perspectives: collaborations and data initiatives
- FAIR data principles: relevant case studies for researchers and staff who support them

And 3 x 1 hour workshops for ResBaz participants as part of the festival

- Impact: get your research noticed
