# FAQs

## How much is registration?

Registration for the festival is free, but for those wanting to attend training workshops (Tuesday to Thursday), there will be a limited number of places with a $33 fee, with lunch provided. Workshops on the Compute day will be free.

## Registerations are full! What do I do?
For workshop tickets, there is a waiting list on eventbrite and we'll inform you as soon as a space opens up.
For the festival, please sign up on the mailing list if you haven't done so. We'll make an announcement as soon as spaces become available

## Will I need a laptop?

If you attend a training workshop, you will generally need a laptop. Set up instructions will be emailed to you prior to the day.

## Can I help out?

Of course! Without volunteers, we couldn't do this every year. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf84vKYZADlIzdNvAcSW9mSZbU9XYhIqZKxaRdmMDDBm5dgNQ/viewform">Register for our mailing list</a>, and tick the box to say you'd like to volunteer to let us know you're interested. If you're attending the festival, we'd strongly encourage you participate by submitting a poster or lightning talk. These are great ways to introduce yourself to the broader community.
