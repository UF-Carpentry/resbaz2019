If you have any questions regarding installation, do not worry! Come and see us at the Registration and Help desk on Level 1, or ask any ResBaz helper (look for the stars on name tags).

Don't forget apart from the stream workshops we have plenty of elective classes which you choose on the day at the bazaar. The electives  cover some of the "softer" skills on how to promote your research and CV advice, as well as some more advanced technical subjects like cloud computing or LaTeX.

Plus we have scheduled in time for community sessions each day during which we will bring all participants together to work on a common project or to hear from keynote speakers and panels.

## Poster Session

On the morning of Day 1 (Tuesday July 2), the community session will be a poster making session. To encourage collaboration, learning and social activities during ResBaz, we ask that you create a poster during this session and submit it! You donâ€™t have to do this in advance, but if you are eager to have a look at the template, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vnGK9-MAA8xspynSxyah8LN6HhjUWgki_L2btXCFlb4/edit#slide=id.g80ef573b5_2_0" target="_blank">please find the link here</a>.  

If you submit your poster online by the end of morning tea on Day 1 at 11am you will be entered into the prize draw for the door prize at the poster session and sundowner event on Day 2! Please note we will print the posters for you.
